        "text": "Considering that the classic white shirt is the very definition of a wardrobe MVP today, it\u2019s hard to imagine that it created quite the scandal when it made its first appearance back in 1793. Worn by queen Marie Antoinette under a muslin dress for a portrait, it was considered against royal etiquette, far from the status the shirt enjoys today. Over the years, the white shirt has witnessed a\u00a0transformation\u2014what was considered a symbol of wealth in the 19th century as those who didn\u2019t work wore it, was given a (then) revolutionary androgynous spin by Coco Chanel in the \u201920s. Celebrities such as Audrey Hepburn, Lauren Bacall and Katherine Hepburn to Julia Roberts and Gwyneth Paltrow, have done their bit to make it even more iconic. The one-piece wonder continues to intrigues the most current Bollywood set too. Want to take your white shirt from office to cocktail party? Let Sonam Kapoor lead the way\u2014swap those pinstriped trousers for a formal silk maxi skirt and a statement necklace to boot. If it\u2019s a sangeet you\u2019re attending, you can team your white shirt with a lehenga just as easily. Her sister, Rhea Kapoor, shows us how to give the shirt serious cool girl cred. A crisp white with exaggerated shoulders and light stripes, worn with high-waist trousers is just what you need for Saturday night drinks with your girls. What works in this staple\u2019s favour is that it serves as a blank canvas for your sartorial sensibilities, in tune with the occasion in question. For instance, you can wear it with patchwork denim shorts and combat boots like for a music festival or with a feminine midi skirt \u00e0 la Soha Ali Khan to meet the boyfriend\u2019s parents. If you\u2019re looking to add to your ever-increasing collection of white shirts, turn to one in its new-age avatar\u2014the high-low knotted version seen on Malaika Arora Khan or the deconstructed one worn by \u2014are great options. Safe to say, the classic white shirt is anything but basic."

        "text": "We can all admit to that time we swore not to step out of the house in those comfy, button-free, shockingly slimming leggings. The concepts of pants and leggings are not quite the same, clearly\u2014the volume of literature on the topic proves this. But the odds weigh in the favour of ease and what\u2019s the general harm, we ask? One of the most-cited arguments against leggings is the view of the back. The VPL, the second-skin nature of the garment and the true-to-form visual of someone\u2019s posterior can be a little unsettling; honestly, do we need such clarity of your form? For the sake of comfort sans faux pas, we recommend a few safety measures. It\u2019s best to pick one after the light test. Avoid the thin cotton variety of leggings\u2014they are just thick tights. Pick solid colours with a high thread count and sound opacity to nix the VPL. And just because you can squeeze yourself in a highly stretchy pair of pants, don\u2019t forget about the muffin top. The resort 2017 lines embraced the rise of athleisure in mainstream fashion. Stylist and designer Andrea Lieberman of clothing line A.L.C. presented her resort 2017 mixed with everyday gym wear\u2014think a gorgeous chunky knit over your favourite Nike tights. At M Missoni, the approach to leggings was far more direct\u2014if you work out, there\u2019s nothing to hide and second skin was the statement you made with form fitting clothing. C\u00e9dric Charlier went safe with suede leggings and crop tops, but not without an oversized boyfriend blazer to cover the rear. An ardent supporter of the \u2018pants are pants\u2019 rule might be hesitant to step out of their comfort zone, into a more comfortable zone. Instead of regular spandex, try leather leggings\u2014a bit more \u2018occasion friendly\u2019 than what you sweat in on the gym floor. Seasoned rule breakers, feel free to step out in your favourite pair of workout leggings. Just do your best to stay away from the neon prints that are more gym friendly than street. When in doubt, ask thy celebrity\u2014take cue for your favourite stars on making runway trends more wearable. From the Kardashians to Sonam Kapoor, celebs have already given in to the comforts of stretchy pants. Go through our gallery for more ideas on how to work this tricky trend."
