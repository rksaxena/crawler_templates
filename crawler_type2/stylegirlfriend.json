All month we\u2019ll be\u00a0throwing down the gauntlet: 31 days, no jeans, game on. Each week, we\u2019ll focus on\u00a0a jeans-free alternative and share daily outfit inspiration . What\u2019s more? We\u2019ll be rewarding a stylish reader every week who shares a non-denim selfie using #NoJeansJanuary on social media with #SGapproved swag. A few sleeps ago (ahem, four months\u2019 worth of sleeps ago), Gabi highlighted what turned out to be a pretty polarizing pant: the cropped trouser . Although the ladies of Style Girlfriend have nothing-but-love for this intentionally shorter trouser, we can see how you\u2019d want to avoid a look that\u2019s dangerously similar to the accidental high-water pants of the past. Until now OKAY. The key to nailing this style? A purposeful fit. And by that, we mean a cropped trouser with a slightly tapered leg and a rising hem between one to three inches. Pairing this pant with a casual outfit will take some of the \u201cis this office appropriate?\u201d pressure off while leaving room to branch out into a trendy-meets-classic vibe. Trousers: Vince, $265 | Bomber j acket: Topman, $150 | Tee: Champion, $38 Socks: Gap, $8 | Shoes: Clarks, $79 | Duffel bag: Uri Minkoff, $150 Watch:  Diesel, $100  | Sunglasses: Steven Allan, $165 | Gloves: Gizelle Renee, $39 All purpose wash: Triumph & Disaster, $34 | Matcha powder:  Mizuba Tea Co., $20 \u201cY\u2019all thought we were gonna let you forget about our love of cropped trousers? You\u2019re not getting off that easy.\u201d TELL ME: ARE YOU ON BOARD TO TRY CROPPED TROUSERS? HOW WOULD YOU STYLE THEM? Pin It"

        "text": "It\u2019s that time again! Time for my new year\u2019s resolutions. For yours, too! For all of ours! ::breaks into song at the top of her lungs, \u2018WE ARE FAM-IL-YYYY\u2019:: Actually, it was that time l-i-i-i-ke, a week or two ago, but here we are. Honestly, it\u2019s hard to believe we\u2019ve already dove headlong into 2017. If I expected a post-holiday lull, I was sorely mistaken. I always go into Christmas thinking I\u2019ll make time to plan for the coming year after the holiday drama\u2014I mean festivities\u2014have died down. I picture myself sitting cross-legged, a chai-scented candle burning in front of me, a dream journal splayed open in my lap, visualizing my way into a prosperous, love- and abundance- filled new year. But y\u2019know what? That never happens. Last year I did take a few days for myself down in Costa Rica before joining friends in a nearby beach town for New Year\u2019s. I had every intention of, well, setting intentions, and getting my mind right for 2016. It didn\u2019t really work. I know there\u2019s a difference in being alone vs. lonely. As in, you can be sitting right next to someone and if they\u2019re not the right someone you feel lonely as hell. But this was different. I was all by myself and feeling bummed thinking backwards and kind of freaked out about looking forwards, so I just\u2026didn\u2019t do much of anything, really. I read books (Girl on a Train, more like, Girl on a Brain Drain, amirite? No? Wrong audience?) . I got some sun. I did have some epiphanies around the mental release brought on by adding limitations to your life, but I didn\u2019t really set any goals for the new year. I didn\u2019t say: This is what I learned in 2015, and here\u2019s how I want to grow from it in 2016. Ultimately what it came down to is that I didn\u2019t want to reflect. 2015 was a weird one. Lots of growing pains, which is in itself not a bad thing, but not necessarily something you want to savor like it\u2019s a cup of coffee in a Folger\u2019s commercial (side note: do they still make Folger\u2019s commercials where someone makes coffee really early in a beautiful house and then someone else \u2013 or maybe a dog \u2013 comes and joins them? They never get served to me on Hulu if they do, and I don\u2019t have a TV so I don\u2019t know what normal commercials run these days. So Hulu, if you\u2019re reading this: I know I don\u2019t drink coffee which you also probably know because the internet knows everything, but please serve them to me, anyway. I love them and promise to be a Folger\u2019s evangelist to all my friends. Look, I\u2019m doing it already!) As it turns out, 2016 did really feel like another \u2018rebuilding year\u2019 for SG and my life (one and the same, really) like a Pac-10 school just trying to make the Buffalo Wild Wings Citrus Bowl. And if anything, 2016 felt like more of a slog. Sure, there was the obvious but beyond that, it felt a bit at times like I was walking through waist-deep mud. I wanted to go faster, but couldn\u2019t. Or didn\u2019t, anyway. But whether the mud was of my own making or not is for another post (or more likely, my therapist) ; the point is, 2017! New year! New possibilities! Let\u2019s do this! Aspirational instagram quotes aside, I\u2019m feeling hopeful\u2014empirical data notwithstanding. I mean, okay. Are resolutions scientifically proven\u00a0to fail , creating a depressing shame spiral that leaves the resolution-maker worse for wear before even flipping the calendar to February? Sure. Does that mean I love \u2018em any less? Nope. Because aspiring for better\u2014to want to make an effort at making an effort \u2014is always a good thing. Even if you fall short, you\u2019re still better off than you were before. Unless your resolution is to like, not kill people, and then\u2014oops, you totally kill some people. That\u2019s more of a binary, no-question fail that should in fact result in a shame spiral. And jail time. Beyond all that, I let myself off the hook recently\u00a0in making a resolution for this year because I was still up to my elbows with the last one. December\u2019s always busy for us at work with gift-giving and -getting season, so most of my free time recently has been spent hustling to button-up recaps and downloads from projects last month. What did we do right? (Some stuff!) What can we do better next time? (Plenty!) Now that all that is out of the way, I am ready to think about January. And 2017 in general. Sure, we\u2019re already in full swing with No Jeans January , but that\u2019s been in the works for awhile (side note: are you guys enjoying it? do you love it? hate it? indifferent?) but better late than never. So getting to it already. This year I\u2019m focusing on simplicity . Even the word sounds enticing, doesn\u2019t it? Like a hot chocolate made with almond milk so it\u2019s kind of good for you but then you also have the barista top it with a big-ass homemade marshmallow from the display case and you are just like, \u201cWHAT? I DO WHAT I WANT.\u201d Yes, simplicity\u2019s like that. I am super duper guilty of taking on too much, and prioritizing work over\u2026pretty much everything else. Which, fine, that\u2019s my choice when it comes to putting Style Girlfriend ahead of things like \u201cbuilding a family\u201d or \u201cnurturing hobbies\u201d (did I spell that right? maybe the \u201ch\u201d is silent?), but fetishizing being busy is not a good look, and what\u2019s more, I don\u2019t want to be too busy all the freaking time. I need to find a way to build a career and build a personal life in tandem. Cutting out anything extraneous will help me get there. It\u2019s not sexy or flashy or even all that tangible. But at the end of 2017, I hope to be able to look back and think, \u201c Ahhhhh \u201d instead of \u201cAHHHHH!!!!\u201d That, to me, will be success. So, tell me: Are you setting a resolution this year? If so, what is it? If not, why not? Pin It"

Such a fun word to say, right? Trousers. TROUsers. Trouserzzz? Yet the thought of actually wearing them tends to dampen every guy\u2019s style spirits. I get it. If you\u2019re not careful, an outfit that includes dress pants can veer towards the corporate. The boring. The stuffy. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.

There\u2019s easily between two and 200 compelling reasons to commit to a patterned trouser. Though, we\u2019ll stick to two for now: A classic subdued pattern paired with solid basics is\u00a0all it takes to create a non-wallpaper looking outfit.
