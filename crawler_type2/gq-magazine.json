If you\u2019ve seen the images from the MAN show - where Per G\u00f6tesson, Feng Chen Wang and Charles Jeffrey Loverboy presented their collections - then you\u2019ve probably seen the image of the indescribable papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 blob \u201clook\u201d (don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re not going to call it an outfit) from Charles Jeffrey Loverboy. \u201cNo one would ever wear that\u201d, we hear you collectively cry. \n    \n    \n\nWell don\u2019t worry. We can confirm that no matter your fashion credentials, no matter how \u201cedgy\u201d you might perceive your own personal style to be, absolutely no one expects you to wear the conceptual, theatrical pieces you see on the catwalk. The key is to think of them more as props or costumes than as conventional clothing - and never, ever assume that this stuff is supposed to be ready-to-wear. \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        Photography by Chris Yates\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Advertisement\n            \n        \n    \nOutlandish runway designs are a form of wearable art, interspersed with the conceivably wearable items for several reasons. First and foremost, designers themselves usually see their shows as an expression of creativity and of their own artistic sensibilities, rather than as purely commercial endeavours. Catwalks shows are about more than just clothes, they\u2019re a holistic, immersive experience. Because we all buy clothes - and because clothing itself is a necessity that we must all engage with to some degree - that\u2019s the bottom line that we tend to forget.For young, independent designers, fresh out of fashion college - and MAN is an initiative specifically intended to showcase emerging talent - their shows are a chance to do something extraordinarily memorable and to get people talking. After all, it\u2019s the bold, experimental shows that get the kudos, as the British Fashion Awards menswear designer of the year Craig Green has proven. Unwearable looks add depth to the collections that will actually be available in shops by emphasising the designers intentions and themes, whether that\u2019s to make an intentionally subversive statement about the \u201cpost-truth\u201d insanity of the world we live in (as is the case with Charles Jeffrey Loverboy), or to draw attention to certain cuts, colours and fabrics. \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n        Craig Green AW13\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Advertisement\n            \n        \n    \nAnother reason is simply to make things more interesting. Even the youngest editors, front row regulars and faithful fashion followers can become rather jaded - there are 30 catwalk shows on the four day LFWM schedule alone this year (not including the designers showing their collections in presentation form). If you really want to stand out \u2013 not to mention getting the kind of media coverage that could make you a household name - you need to do more than dress the models in clothes that would fit right in on your local high street.In our boring, cookie-cutter world, where everyone emulates the same few style icons and where, again and again, we look for rehashes and repeats of the same old stuff - there\u2019s very little out there actually feels new. To create something unlike anything that has been seen before is an aesthetic achievement in itself. At its very core, art is about novelty \u2013 and given that designers are fundamentally artists, we must expect them to take artistic risks to get their work noticed. So when you\u2019re flicking through the photo galleries documenting LFWM and the show seasons ahead, remember this: you are viewing a work of art, not a clothes rail. \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        Photography by press\n    \n\n    \n        Xander Zhouh AW17\n    \n\n\n                    \n\n                    {\"article_uid\": \"yRbAvM61DeZ\"}\n                    \n                        Share this Article"

However, while the way the brand presents its clothes is changing, there are still certain things that aren't: the first being Maier's dedication to creating louche, completely-covetable menswear using the most superb materials, and the second being his commitment to using the finest photographers to capture them on film every season.Case in point: Bottega Veneta\u2019s Art of Collaboration series, which has been running since Maier joined the comapny in 2001. Having already collaborated with big names like Nan Goldin, Peter Lindbergh and Juergen Teller, this season it's American photographer Todd Hido who's been asked to capture the mood of Bottega Veneta for Spring/Summer 2017.\n\n\n    \n        Advertisement\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n\nThe campaign has been shot in New York City at Paul Rudolph's stunning, Modernist Modulightor Building in Midtown - appropriate considering Hido has made his career shooting urban and suburban architecture across America. Of course, the stark white interiors also provide a convenient canvas for Bottega's colour-heavy new season - as well as its campaign models Joan Smalls, Vittoria Ceretti, Hannes Gobeyn, Morten Nielsen and legendary actress Lauren Hutton (who fans of American Gigolo - aka one of the greatest menswear films of all time - will know carried one of the label's intrecciato bags in the movie).\n\n\n    \n        MORE FASHION\n        \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                        The women of Pitti Uomo AW17\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                            STREET STYLE The women of Pitti Uomo AW17\n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                        The strongest street style at Pitti Uomo AW17\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                            STREET STYLE The strongest street style at Pitti Uomo AW17\n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Jim Chapman on his new year's style resolutions\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                            FASHION Jim Chapman on his new year's style resolutions\n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Ralph Lauren is opening Mayfair's preppiest new bar\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                            FASHION Ralph Lauren is opening Mayfair's preppiest new bar\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \nDrink in the stunning architecture and superb menswear below...\n\n\n    \n        Advertisement\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n\n    bottegaveneta.com\n\n                    \n\n                    {\"article_uid\": \"PAE745b7b6v\"}\n                    \n                        Share this Article"

And last night at the 2017 Golden Globes, that\u2019s exactly what Donald Glover  - aka  recording artist Childish Gambino - did, by going against the grain and opting for a brown velvet Gucci suit for the awards ceremony. Glover, who accepted his first award for Best Comedy Series for Atlanta (which he created, wrote and starred in), broke several big menswear rules - yet he\u2019s still our most stylish man of the night, proving sartorial stipulations can be ignored from time to time. \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        Photography by PA Photos\n    \n\n    \n\nAmong the sea of traditional black and navy blue suits, Glover\u2019s brown two piece stood out as a bold update for formalwear and as a cool expression of his personal style. Velvet has been making an appearance on the red carpet for some time (see Eddie Redmayne), but we haven\u2019t seen it in this wintery shade of brown before. Velvet has a vintage vibe to it - think gentlemanly smoking jackets - and gives the tuxedo a touch of the Hollywood greats. When it comes to bossing black tie, we\u2019d usually advise that a velvet jacket be worn with black trousers - rather than as part of a full two piece velvet suit - but Glover demonstrates how, with enough swagger, almost any look can be made to work by the individual wearer. Another accepted convention Glover\u2019s look goes against is the pairing of black shoes with a brown suit - his simple Christian Louboutins, just on the right side of shiny, allow the velvet two piece to do the talking.\n\n\n    \n        Advertisement\n            \n        \n    \nIn an era of over-the-top outfitting, Glover\u2019s outfit serves as a great reminder that if you want to stand out, choosing a classic cut in a non-traditional fabric and in an unconventional colour is the way to go. Although that\u2019s not to say that a regular look doesn\u2019t also deserve kudos - our honourable mention goes to Ryan Reynolds, who got traditional black-tie just right in classic Gucci. One thing's for sure gentleman, if you're in need of a great evening suit, you need to get yourselves down to Gucci. \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        Photography by Getty Images\n    \n\n    \n\n\n                    \n\n                    {\"article_uid\": \"BJPWWP5zv2w\"}\n                    \n                        Share this Article"

My friends and family are all kitted out thanks to my hand-me-downs and I feel that my collection now ticks all the boxes. I know that I can make pretty much any outfit from the options that I have and so I think it's time to streamline. I'm a big believer in quality over quantity and I like to invest in my clothes. I look after what I have and I wear items for many years. But you can have too much of a good thing, and owning too many clothes to choose from can be counterproductive. But what stays and what goes? I shall have to be strict with myself and hand down anything that hasn't been worn for a season or longer.\n    \n        A rose between 2 thorns (very sexy @jaguaruk D Type thorns) at #goodwoodrevival.

I train up to six times a week and it's a big part of my life, but I'm reluctant to invest in new gear, as I'm only going to sweat in it. However, on the rare occasion that I do get a new T-shirt or pair of shorts, I turn up to the gym with newfound gusto. Anyone who trains regularly can attest to the fact that your head has to be in the game to get the most out of your session and I genuinely feel that when I look right it has a big impact on my work-out.\n    \n        Time to hit the beach!

Hats and I have a somewhat rocky past; I've always liked the idea of wearing them, but as soon as it's on my head, I become acutely aware of it and feel self-conscious. However, I popped into the St James's hatter Lock & Co recently and had a good, long chat about the right kind of hat for me and came out with four, which I plan to wear all year round.Whatever your resolutions for 2017, be they style-based or not, I hope they help make your January a little more bearable.Like this?

As The Guardian\u2019s fashion editor Jess Cartner-Morley says, \u201cBowie made art out of his clothes.\u201d\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        Photography by Rex Features\n    \n\n    \n\nAndrogynyHis willingness to push boundaries became apparent with the cover of his third studio album The Man Who Sold The World where he was photographed reclining on a chaise longue in a \u201cman dress\u201d \u2013 although the original cover was, in fact, a cartoon. The piece had been designed by Michael Fish who as Mr Fish had been one of Swinging London\u2019s leading trendsetters and the inventor of the kipper tie. Bowie went on to wear the dress for interviews. This underlined his early fascination with androgyny a theme echoed on the cover of his next album Hunky Dory, where Bowie was pictured channelling Marlene Dietrich \u2013 another influence that stayed with him in various forms throughout his career.\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        Photography by Rex Features\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Advertisement\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n\nZiggy is bornThe real turning point in Bowie\u2019s fashion progress came with his collaboration with Japanese designer Kansai Yamamoto whom he met when the latter learned that Bowie had been wearing pieces of his womenswear on stage. It was Yamamoto who designed the kimonos and knitted unitards that came to personify the Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane era\u2013 and helped invent glam rock. The famous hairstyle was the work of Bowie\u2019s mother Peggy\u2019s hairstylist Suzi Fussey in Beckenham and was inspired by a model in a Yamamoto photo shoot (Fussey later married Bowie\u2019s guitarist Mick Ronson). Not all the tropes of this time were deliberate, however. The famous eyepatch came about when Bowie contracted conjunctivitis before an important interview \u2013 he liked the look so much, however, he adopted it. He also claimed that he had shaved off his eyebrows in a fit of pique when Mott The Hoople turned down his song \u201cDrive-In Saturday\u201d.\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        Photography by Rex Features\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        MORE FASHION\n        \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                        The women of Pitti Uomo AW17\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                            STREET STYLE The women of Pitti Uomo AW17\n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                        The strongest street style at Pitti Uomo AW17\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                            STREET STYLE The strongest street style at Pitti Uomo AW17\n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Your first look at Bottega Veneta's super-luxe summer line\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                            FASHION Your first look at Bottega Veneta's super-luxe summer line\n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Jim Chapman on his new year's style resolutions\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                            FASHION Jim Chapman on his new year's style resolutions\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        Photography by Getty Images\n    \n\n    \n\nThe Thin White DukeThe look, however, had run its course by the time he came to take Diamond Dogs on tour in 1974 and the \u201ccat from Japan\u201d was reinvented as the early soul man in oversized suits, such as the blue Yves Saint Laurent look he wears on the cover of David Live album. Fittingly, when Hedi Slimane took the reins at Saint Laurent he openly cited Bowie as one of his greatest influences and after the singer\u2019s death he penned this tribute for the V&A Magazine, \u201cJuly 1975. I open my birthday present and I meet David for the first time, at the age of seven. David Live, recorded in Philadelphia one year before, is about to change my life.\u201dSlimane\u2019s biggest influence came from Bowie\u2019s Thin White Duke look from Station To Station in 1976 that carried on through to the Berlin period of Low and Heroes.

It was Brown who created the pink jumpsuit and duster coat that Bowie wore in the video for the 1979 single \u201cDJ\u201d, which sees the singer pushing through London streets as strangers grab and try to kiss him. Today Brown lives and works in rural Norfolk with his iconic Old Town label.\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        Photography by Getty Images\n    \n\n    \n\nAfter the Lindsay Kemp inspired Scary Monsters moment, Bowie made what in retrospect looks like one of his rare sartorial missteps with the pastel shoulder-padded suit moment of the Let\u2019s Dance era in the mid-Eighties \u2013 although his besuited appearance at Live Aid proved to be one of the greatest musical moments of the decade. While reporting on his \u201cSerious Moonlight\u201d tour Time magazine deemed it noteworthy to comment on the fact that he wore a wristwatch while performing \u2013 apparently a very unusual thing at that time. \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Advertisement\n            \n        \n    \nThe later yearsBy the late Nineties Bowie started to work with the then upcoming fashion wunderkind Alexander McQueen who created costumes for his 1996 tour, as well as the Union Jack coat Bowie wears on the cover of the 1997 album Earthling. \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n\nIn August of that same year Bowie was shot for British GQ by fashion director Jo Levin in Paul Smith suits and brown Grenson brogues \u2013 the singer had long been a fan of Smith\u2019s work and the designer recalls, \u201cHe once came into the Fifth Avenue shop and bought every shirt in his size. It was mind-blowing. Thrilling.\u201d One of the images from this shoot is still on the wall outside the GQ fashion office and looks as fresh today as it did 20 years ago. Not surprisingly in a BBC poll in 2013 Bowie was voted the best-dressed Brit in history. He won 48.5 per cent, beating Elizabeth I into second place.Sadly, the very last project of Bowie\u2019s life was a collaboration with his old friend Smith on a limited-edition Dark Star T-shirt design. Smith had them hanging on the installation he had created for the January 2016 London Collections with the Pace Gallery \u2013 it was, by coincidence, the day that the news came through that Bowie had died. \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        Photography by Peter Robathan\n    \n\n    \n\n\n                    \n\n                    {\"article_uid\": \"mp6BdLbo5Gq\"}\n                    \n                        Share this Article"

And unlike many famous men you see on the red carpet, Britain\u2019s biggest rapper hasn\u2019t earned this reputation by always relying on a stylist. This is a man who clearly loves clothes and cares about what he wears. You can see it in his continually evolving style since he burst onto our collective playlists with \u201cPass Out\u201d in 2009; you can see it in the fact that everything he wears is tailored perfectly for his physique; you can see it in the fact he\u2019s been an ambassador for men\u2019s fashion week in London since it started back in 2011. However, now he\u2019s taking on a new task: translating his personal style into a menswear line.\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n        Advertisement\n            \n        \n    \nIn vogue with the current trend for big brands shaking up the traditional timetables of the international fashion weeks, Tinie\u2019s new line What We Wear had its debut with a show on the Saturday of the packed schedule of the newly rechristened London Fashion Week Men\u2019s this January. And while he\u2019s dabbled in apparel before with his Disturbing London brand (a mostly-merch line he\u2019s designed with his manager, Dumi Oburota, for almost a decade), this is his first foray into full-blown fashion.\n\n\n    What We Wear Autumn/Winter 2017\n    What We Wear Autumn/Winter 2017\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    View gallery\n\n\n\n    \n        MORE LONDON FASHION WEEK MEN'S\n        \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Inside the London Fashion Week Men\u2019s closing dinner\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                            LONDON FASHION WEEK MEN'S Inside the London Fashion Week Men\u2019s closing dinner\n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                        The big menswear trends from London Fashion Week Men's AW17\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                            LONDON FASHION WEEK MEN'S The big menswear trends from London Fashion Week Men's AW17\n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Why you see things you\u2019d never wear on the catwalk\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                            LONDON FASHION WEEK MEN'S Why you see things you\u2019d never wear on the catwalk\n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Get a closer look at the items in Tinie Tempah's debut What We Wear line\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                            LONDON FASHION WEEK MEN'S Get a closer look at the items in Tinie Tempah's debut What We Wear line\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \nLooking through the collection, Tinie has taken the sporty trend that\u2019s currently running through menswear, and crafted a collection for athleisure-obsessed men. This interchangeability is born out of a controlled palette of navy, black, grey and white, but it\u2019s also in the types of items he\u2019s chosen to include. While his tracksuit (sleek, slim, straightforward and cut from a sheen-like material with extra-long drawstrings at the waist) is the central item in the collection, there are plenty of pieces in the line with which it can be worn to give a whole new vibe: a pair of his slouchy-tailored track trousers, a soft, mid-grey sweatshirt or one of his boxy T-shirts. So far, so sportsluxe.\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        Photography by Don Fleming\n    \n\n    \n        Tinie Tempah wears a selection of What We Wear, launching in April. From \u00a365 to \u00a3400. whatwewear.com\n    \n\n\n\n    \n        Advertisement\n            \n        \n    \nHowever, as with Tinie\u2019s personal style, what sets these items apart are the details: those black track trousers we mentioned have a rubbery white logo artfully squiggling down the side instead of go-faster stripes; that grey sweatshirt has layered-effect sleeves; those boxy T-shirts have press studs all down the shoulders and torso, allowing you to attach the front of one colour to the back of another to create a whole new item. His jean jacket is -traditional in shape and style \u2013 however, it\u2019s cut not from denim, but from semi-transparent white rubberised plastic, allowing you to show off what\u2019s underneath, even during a downpour.\n    \"I decided, why don\u2019t we actually make something that we would actually wear?\"\n It\u2019s these unexpected twists that add a fashionable edge \u2013 not to mention serious covetability \u2013 to every item, and yet, crucially, does not impact on their wearability or practicality. In fact, it\u2019s the twists that enhance these qualities. \u201cWhen you go to the fashion shows, a lot of the models walking down the catwalk are wearing these extravagant pieces,\u201d says Tinie. \u201cBut I\u2019ll see the model in Shoreditch two weeks later and they\u2019ll be wearing something more like this. So I decided, \u2018Why don\u2019t we -actually make something we would actually wear?\u2019\u201d Of course, rappers launching clothing brands is nothing new. Over in the US, home of the personal lifestyle brand, most hip hop artists have given it a go. Pharrell and Kanye West have both won over the current streetwear scene with BBC Ice Cream and Yeezy respectively, and P Diddy saw rich rewards from Sean John for many years. 50 Cent, though, wasn\u2019t quite so lucky (RIP G-Unit clothing). However, you get the sense that if there\u2019s any man who can conquer the menswear market, it\u2019s Tinie. Having finished our shoot, for which he\u2019s modelled three of his key looks from the line, we\u2019re now in his living room, located on the first floor with a view of Victoria Park to the front and, behind his grand piano, a view of his own perfectly manicured garden to the rear. He\u2019s reclining on a golden-yellow, Ostrich-leather sofa, sporting one of his own black tracksuits, zipped low to expose his toned chest and a neck hung with delicate gold chains. And he wears it all with the kind of wide-smiled warm confidence that any guy would buy if it could be bottled.\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \u201cI felt like it was the right time to make a clothing line that people would acknowledge and respect.\u201d\n\n\n\n    Get a closer look at the items in Tinie Tempah's debut What We Wear line\n    Get a closer look at the items in Tinie Tempah's debut What We Wear line\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    View gallery\nIncidentally, that sofa we mentioned was installed by the house\u2019s previous owner, Alexander McQueen. While Tinie has made his own suitably ballsy additions to the building (we particularly approve of the hot tub on the roof), traces of the designer are everywhere \u2013 especially in the artwork, such as the taxidermy giraffe\u2019s head hanging in the stairwell outside, left by the designer before he moved out shortly before his untimely death. These are things Tinie proudly preserves as a constant source of inspiration; they give him faith that, like McQueen, he can become a major player in the British fashion industry.\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        Photography by Don Fleming\n    \n\n    \n        Tinie Tempah wears a selection of What We Wear, launching in April.

Eventually he\u2019d like to expand into directing music videos, animation and even architecture (\u201cI\u2019m always thinking of how to make spaces people want to be in. I always dream of having this big spread of land where I can build something that you\u2019d usually see in LA, but in Kent\u201d). How he does this, we can\u2019t predict just yet (although his passion for his collection tells us he\u2019ll give it everything he\u2019s got). What\u2019s certain is that launching What We Wear won\u2019t be the last time Tinie expands his sphere of -influence on his journey to owning a world--dominating personal brand \u2013 but it\u2019s one hell of a stylish stop along the way, and one we hope to revisit for many seasons to come.\n    What We Wear launches in April, from \u00a365 to \u00a3400. whatwewear.com\n\n\n\n    Your exclusive first look at the What We Wear lookbook\n    Your exclusive first look at the What We Wear lookbook\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    View gallery\n\n                    \n\n                    {\"article_uid\": \"V2q3Yj3XnO4\"}\n                    \n                        Share this Article"

This Thursday, Ralph's Coffee & Bar is opening up in-store.This is the first time that the label has opened one of its restaurants here in Britain - and it's a beautiful hybrid of its other outposts around the world, combining the intimate feel of Ralph's in Paris, the barista brilliance of Ralph\u2019s Coffee in New York and the after-hours Manhattan elegance of The Polo Bar.\n\n\n    \n        Advertisement\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n\nKitted out in that kind of all-American style that's made Ralph Lauren world-famous (polished brass, dark wood panelling, rich green fabric and saddle leather on the seats, and plenty of horse-related paraphernalia) and with under 40 covers, the bar has that cosy, quintessentially intimate feel of an East Coast gentleman's club.\n\n\n    \n        MORE FASHION\n        \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                        The women of Pitti Uomo AW17\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                            STREET STYLE The women of Pitti Uomo AW17\n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                        The strongest street style at Pitti Uomo AW17\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                            STREET STYLE The strongest street style at Pitti Uomo AW17\n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Your first look at Bottega Veneta's super-luxe summer line\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                            FASHION Your first look at Bottega Veneta's super-luxe summer line\n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Jim Chapman on his new year's style resolutions\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                                \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                        \n                            FASHION Jim Chapman on his new year's style resolutions\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n\nThis vibe doesn't just come from the the decor - it's also built into the menu. Serving breakfast and light meals, you'll find classic stateside comfort food like club sandwiches, cobb salads and cheesecake on offer, as well as more European options such as tuna tartare or celeriac soup.However, as you can tell by its name, the emphasis of the establishment is on its drinks offering (its worth noting that the beverage menu is twice as thick as the one for food).\n\n    \n        Advertisement\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n    \n\nAs well as an impressively broad selection of coffee styles to cater to even the most demanding caffeine consumer, from Cortado connoisseurs to Americano aficionados (all brewed using Ralph's signature blend using organically grown beans and crafted by American roasters La Colombe), there's also a fully stocked bar manned by some seriously talented mixologists.You can get a special preview of Ralph's Coffee & Bar here in our gallery, but if you truly want to experience the sort of stellar sprit action on offer at home before you come into the city, we've got the recipe for one of the bar's signature cocktails exclusively below.
