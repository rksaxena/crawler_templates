        "text": "C\u00e9line When a piece emerges year after year as a favorite, it becomes a fashion staple\u2014and this is exactly what we consider C\u00e9line bags to be. The experts at The RealReal named C\u00e9line as one of the most difficult brands\u00a0to keep in stock. They also labeled\u00a0tote bags, like the Twisted Cabas tote, as the second most in-demand style after the crossbody. Fashion Director Kate Foley of Vestiaire Collective calls\u00a0C\u00e9line bags enduring wardrobe staples, particularly the Trotteur bag, saying,\u00a0\"The C\u00e9line Trotteur is such a great investment because it's so classic and minimal. It's elegant and feels like it will transcend trends to become a timeless piece.\" Sacai Sacai is known for its minimal, sporty\u00a0womenswear, and, as of 2016, the line now also includes bags. Foley of Vestiaire Collective says the brand is \"a newcomer to the scene, as Sacai just launched their first collection of handbags. Given [Sacai founder] Chitose Abe's genius and the popularity of its new collection, this is something we are going to see a lot of in the future!\" The horseshoe bag serves as the perfect everyday style for women on the go. Mark\u00a0Cross Sleek, timeless shapes\u00a0define the look of Mark Cross bags, a favorite for fashion girls that has been skyrocketing in popularity\u00a0on the street-style scene. Foley is similarly enthusiastic, noting,\u00a0\"The Mark Cross Grace box bag has been so popular and the interest doesn't seem to be dying down anytime soon. It's such a classic, simple bag that can transition from day to evening. Such a great investment!\" Gucci No surprises here, as Gucci continues to reinvent its style while staying true to the edgy glamour that defines the brand. The RealReal notes that \"anything and everything Gucci\" is snatched up quickly, and adds, \"Particularly the Dionysus and Tian will continue to be in high demand in the secondary market in 2017. The Gucci moment is definitely having a halo effect on all Gucci handbags.\" Gucci's timeless appeal certainly doesn't seem to be letting up anytime soon. Loewe If anything in fashion is\u00a0for certain in 2017, it's that\u00a0the Loewe Puzzle bag is still going strong. The RealReal explains, \"This bag is another great example of creative genius combined with exceptional craftsmanship, and 2016/2017 are all about the crossbody\u2014so this will continue to be a strong seller heading into the New Year.\" With practicality balancing style in equal measure, it's no wonder that gorgeous crossbody styles like the Puzzle bag continue to strike a chord with fashion girls. J.W.Anderson At the end of the day, pinpointing pieces that define your personal style is all about having fun, and this is exactly what J.W.Anderson accomplishes so beautifully with its designs. The Pierce bag in particular has performed exceptionally well, and continues to be a overwhelmingly popular piece. Foley says,\u00a0\"We've seen a lot of Jonathan Anderson's Pierce bag over the past months. Judging by the weird and wonderful new colorways that walked the runway this season, the hype will continue!\" Herm\u00e8s Another wardrobe staple, Herm\u00e8s's designs, like the Constance bag, are absolute investment pieces. According to The RealReal, \"Again, the small crossbody is the bag to have right now. The resale price of this style has been increasing every year, and because it's such a classic style, it will definitely stand the test of time. In terms of supply, it's as hard to get as a Birkin. Eighty percent of our crossbody bags we got this year sold within a month!\" It looks like the crossbody isn't going anywhere anytime soon, especially with gorgeous pieces like Herm\u00e8s's Constance around. You've got your bag inspiration ready for 2017\u2014but do you know the womenswear trend that will blow up next year? Read one celebrity stylist's prediction ."

        "text": "I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m finding it hard to believe that 2017 is now upon us! And I\u2019m excited as ever to make this year the best year yet. While my overall style is pretty classic, I\u2019ve never been one to shy away from change\u2014whether it\u2019s remodeling my home , switching up my beauty routine, or refining my wardrobe. New (and sometimes recycled) trends are proving that the New Year is going to be the chicest yet. Since I\u2019ve already been planning my upcoming collections for both Paper Crown and LC Lauren Conrad , you can bet that I have a pretty hefty list of trends that I\u2019ve had my eye on. Today I\u2019m going to share with you five up-and-coming trends that I\u2019m predicting to be huge in 2017. Keep scrolling to see which pieces I\u2019ll be adding into my own closet in the coming months\u2026 Pink,\u00a0Please One trend that I\u2019m particularly excited about has to be the rise of pink. I\u2019ve always been a pink girl myself, and I love being able to shop all of the different hues and styles. One piece that I\u2019ve been wearing over and over again this season is my Paper Crown Cologne Jacket . I swear it goes with everything in my closet! Ruffles Ruffles are on the horizon for the upcoming year, and I could not be more excited. There\u2019s nothing more romantic than a ruffled detail, whether it\u2019s on a fancy frock or a feminine blouse. You can bet that I\u2019ll be incorporating this trend into my own wardrobe in more ways than one. Bold\u00a0Stripes It\u2019s true that fashion repeats itself, and these bold \u201970s-inspired stripes are the perfect example. From turtlenecks to dresses to T-shirts, there\u2019s no wrong way to sport a stripe. These are just a few of the many pieces that I\u2019ve had my eye on\u2026 Mules Say hello to the one shoe that\u2019s dominating my closet. Mules in all varieties are taking over the fashion world, and I\u2019m pretty smitten with them. Mule slides are my favorite way to wear this trend, especially with the faux-fur lining. My feet can use a little extra warmth this time of year! Sleeve\u00a0Interest Similar to the ruffle trend I just covered, interesting sleeves have been making quite an impact. Whether it\u2019s bell, cold shoulder, or incorporating some kind of ruffle detail, no top is complete this season without a little embellishment. Which one of these trends do you like best?\u00a0Let me know in the comments! XO, Lauren Opening Image: Steve Erle/Kohl\u2019s"

        "text": "From the cut to the color, every year there\u2019s one ring style that stands out among the rest. Last year it was all about a vintage-inspired design ,\u00a0and this year, we reached out to the talented jeweler designer Jennie Kwon for her expert insight on the style that will be huge next year. \"Our rose-cut diamond rings have gained a ton of momentum throughout the year and we predict that this will continue in 2017,\" she said. \"The couples we meet with are less concerned about carat size and something that's large andstatement-making in the traditional sense. Rose-cut diamonds speak to them because of their quiet brilliance and one-of-a-kind shapes. Each of our rings designed around a rose cut diamond is unique and brides-to-be appreciate the fact that their ring is theirs and theirs alone. They're different from your traditional brilliant-cut diamond while still having the permanence of a diamond.\" So, if you\u2019re planning on getting engaged and want an on-trend ring, opt for a beautiful rose-cut diamond. If you\u2019re not sure what a rose-cut rock looks like, don\u2019t sweat it, we\u2019ve gathered the most stunning options on the market right now. See the proof below. Check out the engagement ring trend that\u2019s going to be huge in 2017 below!"

But these It girls didn\u2019t just wear leggings to and from the gym like most of us probably have in seasons past, they reinvented the athleisure staple, pairing them with of-the-moment duster jackets, ankle boots, chunky sweaters, and everything in between. While we all probably had a favorite celeb-approved leggings outfit formula last year (this editor adored the crop top, bomber jacket, and sneakers look, FYI), there are key looks that will be just as big (if not bigger!) coming ahead in 2017. If you\u2019re on the hunt for new legging outfit inspiration, go on to check out the new ways to wear the trend next year. Plus, go a bit further to shop some of our favorite leggings as well."

Cropped\u00a0Flares \"Ankle-crop flare jeans! I feel like I've finally found the denim silhouette best suited for my body. I'm a tad shorter (5'5\"), which means the slim-fit leg and higher hemline with a kick is especially flattering. I'm a crop-flare lifer!\u201d \u2014 Nicole Kliest, Style Director \u201cI refuse to give up cropped flare pants. Whether it's my go-to denim pair or the office favorite from our Target collection , you can find me at the office wearing the pant style three out of five days of the week.\u201d \u2014 Michelle Scanga, Managing Editor Varsity\u00a0Jackets \u201cI can't say I've ever really excelled at a sport in my life, but I've always had a thing for varsity jackets. They're cool, nostalgic, and add a little bit of tomboy style to any look (can't say I've ever been a tomboy either\u2014go figure). This past year, varsity and bomber jackets just happened to be a popular trend, but they'll always be a wardrobe staple\u2014even if an ironic one\u2014for me.\u201d \u2014 Gina Marinelli, Senior News Editor Birkenstocks \u201cI just can't break up with my Birkenstocks. Yes, my dad may have the exact same pair, but they're so easy and comfortable. Must. Keep. Wearing.\u201d \u2014 Aemilia Madden, Fashion Editor Bold\u00a0Stripes \"I am not ready to give up bold stripes. Luckily, they won't be too far off this coming season, just taking new form, as rainbow stripes are a huge trend for spring 2017 .\" \u2014 Lauren Eggertsen, Associate Fashion Editor Denim\u00a0Miniskirts \u201cI'm still really into denim miniskirts. I've even been wearing mine with black tights and sweaters lately because I'm not ready to put it away until summer. Re/Done's reworked Levi's style is my go-to, but so many brands have put out unique versions over the past year or so that it's easy to find a good one at any price point.\u201d \u2014 Allyson Payer, Editor Mules \u201cWhether they're flats or heels, I'm all here for mules in 2017. I hope they've moved into the timeless category at this point, because I can't get enough!\u201d \u2014 Kat Collings, Editorial Director Off-the-Shoulder\u00a0Tops \u201cOff-the-shoulder tops were everywhere last summer. Some people may have grown tired of them already, but there are plenty of new, interesting versions that don't feel dated. I'll be wearing knit versions for winter and switching over to linen and cotton for spring. If it ain't broke, why fix it?\u201d \u2014 Erin Fitzpatrick, News Editor Statement\u00a0Accessories \u201cBags, boots, belts\u2014you name it. The statement accessory trend (largely championed by Gucci) perfectly complements my go-to wardrobe which otherwise consists of white tees, jeans, and everything else in black, so it\u2019s safe to say I\u2019m not turning in those pieces anytime soon.\u201d \u2014 Nicole Akhtarzad, Market Editor Which trends are you unwilling to retire?

The Lauren Santo Domingo\u2013lead team of editors and merchandisers makes the shopping experience educational, as they constantly introduce new designers via their stellar trunk shows and trends that are about to take off. Today's email newsletter provided an excellent example of this in the form of their monthly shopping guide. For January, the site curated a tightly edited assortment of pieces to add to your wardrobe this month , including a pair of cool lace-up khaki pants that they declared \"this season's jeans.\" This isn't the first time we've mentioned khaki pants as an upcoming trend. Back in September, in the midst of S/S 17 fashion month, we also stated that khakis were set for a return based on multiple runway appearances and Vogue 's endorsement of the trend. While the first thing that might\u00a0come to mind when you think of khakis is your dad's pants\u2014along with \"frumpy\" or \"ugly\"\u2014rest assured that the latest styles are feminine, tailored, and forward. Want proof? Keep scrolling to take a look at (and shop) the A.L.C. pair that Moda Operandi endorsed in today's newsletter and a few other styles that we happen to love. Tell us in the comments below if you'd trade your jeans for khakis. "

        "text": "Just weeks into 2017, Zara is already proving to the\u00a0world that it doesn't plan on slowing down in any regard anytime soon. The fast-fashion retailer kicked off the New Year with a selection of products so strong we honestly didn't know where to start. In an effort to help us narrow down the key players of Zara's S/S 17 collection , we reached out to\u00a0Laura Kubica Grigerov\u00e1 of EDITED , a retail analytics company, to give us the inside scoop on the Zara items that they predict will move mountains this year. Laura said, \"We identified top womenswear trends for spring 2017 and matched that with top moving products from Zara. EDITED identifies top moving products as the ones that perform well in the following metrics: price constancy, quick selling, and rapid replenishment.\" In addition to the general roundup of products that EDITED pulled data for, we expanded upon that to identify each with a trend that will be notably present in 2017. With that said, we all know how quickly the top-notch Zara items sell out, so we highly recommend you snatch up the below selection\u00a0while they are still in stock. Scroll down to shop the Zara items that are sure to take off this year! FLOWER\u00a0POWER Whether it's via embroidery or an all-over print, flowers are continuing to make a name for themselves in 2017. PERFECT\u00a0PLAID Menswear plaids are a huge trend for S/S 17 and can be worn in styles ranging from oversize blazers to mini dresses such as this. BARELY\u00a0THERE Instead of ditching your sweaters completely when spring rolls around, opt for sweaters that will allow for a little airflow like this shoulder-bearing version. FINE\u00a0SHINE This year, the fashion world is challenging you to wear coated and leather pieces in alternative ways. CRISP\u00a0COTTON Crisp cottons were seen on the runways of countless designers this season, but we are particularly loving the floral embroidery on this one. IN THE\u00a0STREETS Fun fact: Athleisure is here to stay, so start stocking up on your oversize sweatshirts, sneakers, and streetwear-inspired selects. LIGHT\u00a0WHITES Brighten up your wardrobe this season with a variation of white and cream-colored basics ranging from sweaters to tailored trousers. POP\u00a0ART Personalize your wardrobe this year with pins, patches, and text-adorned items. If you are a Zara fan, you know they go above and beyond\u00a0in this department. NICE\u00a0KNITS Take your knitwear items to the next level in 2017 by reaching for shapes and styles that are more out-of-the-box than your average choice. FURRY\u00a0FRIENDS It looks as if Zara isn't quite ready to get rid of the furry accessories trend just yet. These festive sneakers are a great way to transition the trend into 2017."

        "text": "It's become the norm for decades and their distinctive trends to come back in style for a few seasons before style setters move on to the next. For S/S 17, it's clear that the reign of the '80s revival has begun. Major fashion houses like Gucci, Chanel, Balenciaga, and Saint Laurent featured shoulder pads, neon colors, puffy sleeves, logos, and miniskirts in their collections, recalling the glamour of Dynasty and Heathers . Whether you're ready for the polarizing trends of the decade to return or not, it's already becoming clear that you'll have trouble escaping the '80s this year. One fast-fashion retailer we noticed already fully embracing the trend is Topshop. Neon colors, acid-wash jeans, funnel-neck collars, and even scrunchies are among the seller's new arrivals. Given the fact that the brand fully embraced the '70s and '90s trends that cropped up over the past several years, we fully expect that it'll continue to offer up wallet-friendly '80s-inspired options until the trend has run its course. Keep scrolling to shop '80s-inspired pieces from Topshop (and be sure to tell us what you think of the trend in the comments below)!"

Since fashion bloggers are definitely ahead of the curve when it comes to styling, brands, and the like, trusting their judgment (and taste) is always a good idea. So far, 2017 is looking like a good year for the ladies ahead as they rock some of the season's freshest trends like it ain't no thang. Maybe it's their styling techniques, maybe it's the trends themselves, or maybe it's just us, but we've never seen preppy plaids, '80s glam, and costume jewelry pieces look so good. To be quite frank, we really can't wait to test out the 2017 trends for ourselves. Are you ready for your most stylish year yet?

Sure, it's totally okay to wear one if you have an iteration you love, but with the movement toward looser, boxier silhouettes this year , super-tight frocks just aren't as forward as other styles. Keep scrolling to check out celebs in stylish dresses for NYE inspiration. Plus, go a bit further to shop frocks that will be so IN this holiday season. We promise there's something for everybody to ring in the New Year in style."

Then also think back to when that trend quickly faded and visible brand names became not only obsolete but also uncool. If you saw someone walking down the street in a logo tee, you likely cast instant fashion-girl judgments followed by rapid snickering. Okay, so maybe you weren't that much of a mean girl, but you get the point. Well, we have news for you\u2014this once clich\u00e9 trend is officially back and is nearly replacing band and graphic tees as we know it. Brands and designers alike are churning out tees, sweatshirts, and more with their names plastered all over them. From the blogger-approved (and -obsessed) Gucci T-shirt to the ever-evolving and forever-retro Adidas sweatshirts, this trend has already blown up in the last year and will only get bigger as we navigate our way through 2017. Keep reading to shop the logo tees and to see how the street style set styles them."
